<p>Without having to process more on data, the contents of the microblogs with 30 mins time interval is even more informative.</p>
<p>For instance, from 1700-1800, we know that police presense at pok rally and Dr. Audrey is mentioned several times from 1800. Then from 1830 , fire occurs at dolphin apartment and followed by evacuation. Subsequently, from 1930, a shot/gun fire happened with police involved, followed by injured firefighter and hospitalization. And at 2100 suspects were arrested and followed by an explosion at dolphin apartment from 2130 onward.</p>

<p>As shown above, the meaningful keywords can be found in each topic. From the distribution, we can see that in abnormal topic such as topic 1,5 and 9, the top words are dominating the topic, while in other chatter/junk/spam topics, a few normal words has relatively same high beta value. As such, topics can be identified roughly as below.</p>
<p>Topic 1 - fire at dancing dolphin</p>
<p>Topic 3 - pok rally</p>
<p>Topic 5- police related with evacuation/hostage/standoff</p>
<p>Topic 9 - van/guy</p>
<p>While other topics are more chatter/junk related.</p>
<h3 id="topic-trend"><strong>Topic Trend</strong></h3>
<p>By using gamma value from topic modeling results, we can then assign each document with a topic.</p>

<p>From the topic trend distribution, we can see that chatter topic 1-5 are spreaded all over the time period, and the number of junk posts are small and evenly distributed. While the peaks of key major events are very obvious at certain point of time.</p>
<p>In summary of topic modeling techniques and visualization, we can identify major event from junk/chatter/spam, and the topic trend visualization can help the audience know about temporal pattern of meanningful events distribution.</p>

<p>Visnetwork packages in R provided interactive capability for network visualization. For the plot above, click the nodes and zoom in the graph, the selected node and its network will be highlighted, which can provided the information of how many people are directly affected by the original author and the size of the dot indicates the total number of posts by users.</p>
<p>This chart can be applied to answer quetions 1 and 2.</p>
<p>From the chart, we can tell thatthe authors in the center like <span class="citation" data-cites="HomelandIlluminations">@HomelandIlluminations</span>/<span class="citation" data-cites="AbilaPost">@AbilaPost</span>/<span class="citation" data-cites="KronosStar">@KronosStar</span>/<span class="citation" data-cites="CentralBulletin">@CentralBulletin</span>/<span class="citation" data-cites="NewsOnlineToday">@NewsOnlineToday</span>/<span class="citation" data-cites="InternationalNews">@InternationalNews</span> have affected the public most directly and widely. And users like <span class="citation" data-cites="Clevvah4Evah">@Clevvah4Evah</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="KronosQuoth">@KronosQuoth</span> have quite number of junk posting with no re-tweets, while other users with no link post mainly chatter contents.</p>

<p>Another way to detect the active level of microblog is to visualize the proportion of re-tweet/tweet. As shown in the bar graph above, the peak trend coincides with “Total Number of Posts through the period”, indicating the people are actively eveloved in the events happening in Abila.</p>
<p>The goverment can monitor the ratio of retweet in community to detect abnormal event.</p>
<h3 id="monitor-important-news-source---mainstream-media"><strong>Monitor important news source - Mainstream media</strong></h3>

Their tweet should be closely monitored by local authorities, in particular, when the frequency of re-tweet from the public has raised.</p>
<p>For instance, to understand people’s attention of the abnormal events, we can monitor the words and its relationships in main stream media’s re-tweets.</p>

<p>In the re-tweet from the main media, high occurrence of fire at dolphin apartement has the most co-occurrence re-tweets, indicating highest attention and risk in the community, followed by several events involved with police such as post of pokrally/ arrive at scene. While in the edge of the visualization, we can found that the small group of public was interested in re-tweet firefighter injure at hospital/ suspect arrest, which has less risk in the community.</p>
<h2 id="question-3">Question 3</h2>
<p><strong>4.3 If you were able to send a team of first responders to any single place, where would it be? Provide your rationale. How might your response be different if you had to respond to the events in real time rather than retrospectively? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 500 words.</strong></p>
<p>To send team of responders and make sure right location and short responding time, we can take a closely look location-tagged posts or posts contents with locations.</p>
<p><strong>On retrospective appraoch, I will send team of first respondents to dolphin dancing apartment.</strong></p>
<p>Reasons as below,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The fire event at dolphin get the most attention and risk from the public according to previous analysis. The word file, dolphin department was frequently mentioned in the microblog by mainstream media and individual users.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing to other event, some are reported by only a few individual users with vague locations mentioned in the latter time, the fire at dolphin apartment has been reported with an accurate location at early time around 18:40.</p></li>
