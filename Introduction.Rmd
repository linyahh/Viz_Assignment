On January 23, 2014, multiple events unfolded in Abila. the challenge is to perform a retrospective analysis based on limited information about what took place. The goal is to identify risks and how they could have been mitigated more effectively.
From this data, , I will use visual analytics techniques in R to solve questions from [VAST Challenge 2021: Mini-Challenge 3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/MC3.html). The main data sets includes information of collection of microblogs and emergency calls from the days surrounding the disappearance.
